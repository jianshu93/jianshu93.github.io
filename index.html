My name is Jianshu Zhao, currently a Bioinformatic Ph.D student at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.
Before I came to georgia tech, I did my Masters at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Being a lover of microbiology, I worked with Prof. Yunfeng Yang and Prof. Jizhong Zhou for my masters.
Now I am workong with Prof. Kostas Konstantidinis, studying enironmental microbial genomics. As a bioinfomatician, I develop some tools to better understand large scale DNA and RNA sequence data and try to understand the complexity of natural microbial communities.
I am extremely intereted in understanding the unusual biology of bacterial and archaea in extreme environment such as deep sea sedment (larege than 6000 meters), Tibetan Plateau and Tundra ecosystems.
