My name is Jianshu Zhao, currently a bioinformatic Ph.D student at Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.
Before I came to georgia tech, I did my Masters at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Being a lover of microbiology, I worked with Prof. Yunfeng Yang and Prof. Jizhong Zhou for my masters.
Now I am working with Prof. Kostas Konstantidinis, studying enironmental microbial genomics. As a bioinfomatician, I develop bioinformatic tools to better understand large scale DNA and RNA sequencing data and try to understand the complexity of natural microbial communities.
I am extremely intereted in understanding the unusual biology of bacteria and archaea in extreme environment such as deep sea sedment (larger than 6000 meters), Tibetan Plateau and Tundra ecosystems. For the computational biology related work, I am very interested in classification problems for microbial genomes. I am now studying fast ANN (approximation nearest neighbor) algorithms such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) to accelerate search for close genomes in very large database.
I am a python/R and Rust person and I work on both Linux and MacOS. I love swimming, video gaming, hiking and coding. Contact me at jianshu.zhao@gatech.edu
