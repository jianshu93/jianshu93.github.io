My name is Jianshu Zhao, currently a bioinformatic Ph.D student at Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.
Before I came to georgia tech, I did my Masters at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Being a lover of microbiology, I worked with Prof. Yunfeng Yang and Prof. Jizhong Zhou for my masters.
Now I am working with Prof. Kostas Konstantidinis, studying enironmental microbial genomics. As a bioinfomatician, I develop bioinformatic tools to better understand large scale DNA and RNA sequencing data and try to understand the complexity of natural microbial communities.
I am extremely intereted in understanding the unusual biology of bacteria and archaea in extreme environment such as deep sea sedment (larger than 6000 meters), Tibetan Plateau and Tundra ecosystems.
I am a python/R and Rust person and I work on both Linux and MacOS. I love swimming, video gaming, hiking and coding. Contact me at jianshu.zhao@gatech.edu
